        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This document describes a game called “Shadow Maze”, which is designed to be a 
                simple, 2D top-down game. The game will employ sprite-based animation, tiled background, 
                collision detection, physics, AI, efficient memory management, render threading, and 
                more basic 2D game techniques.

        <h2>Back Story</h2>
            <p>
                It all began with a deadly virus that ravaged the world, causing chaos and devastation. Not only did it kill 
                all humans infected, it also caused mutations in animals, making them extremely aggressive and dangerous. The 
                survivors of a kingdom moved underground, and built a series of mazes to protect themselves from the virus and 
                the mutated creatures that roamed above. 

                Years passed by, and people longed to know if it was safe to return to the surface, but they had forgotten the path 
                through the mazes by then. The prince, a brave and adventurous young man, decided to venture through the mazes to reach 
                the surface. However, they were no longer the peaceful places they had once been. Could the prince make it out alive?
            </p>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
                The prince’s goal is to find his way through the dangerous underground labyrinths, and return to the surface in order 
                to save humanity. The mazes are dark and full of dead ends, so the prince must be able to find the exits with limited 
                light sources. Not only that, there are many dangerous beasts and creatures lurking in the shadows, so the prince must 
                defeat all that comes his way, including a scary boss monster at the exit of each maze!
            </p>
        <h2>GamePlay</h2>
            <p>
                The game will work like a top down game, with the prince being able to run up, down, left, right through various paths available to him.

                The prince will have to be cautious because there are many traps throughout his journey to the outside. The prince will be mentally exhausted 
                as not all the paths will be friendly to him. Some paths may provide hope and some may provide suffering. The prince will only have a limited 
                view of his paths, but with a torch, the prince can increase his radius of light to allow him to see more.
                
                If the prince is lucky enough, he might find a treasure chest containing items that will benefit his journey through the Shadow Mazes. Some 
                of the items can be a lantern or a light stone. The prince has to use his items carefully, because they will be essential for his survival and journey.
                
                In order to protect himself from the various traps and monsters throughout the maze, the prince carries a shield. With the shield, the prince 
                can block attacks, and if timed correctly, he has the ability to reflect ranged attacks or stun enemies with melee attacks. With each shield 
                action, the prince is able to charge his energy bar that will be part of his attack.
                
                The prince’s attack will be with a sword that can be both melee and ranged. The prince’s melee attack can charge his energy bar as well, but 
                when the prince sends a flying sword slash, the energy bar will be drained completely. The prince will have to be careful when to use his 
                flying sword slash, since it will be crucial to his survival in the shadow mazes.

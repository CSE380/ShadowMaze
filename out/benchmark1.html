        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This document describes a game called “Shadow Maze”, which is designed to be a 
                simple, 2D top-down game. The game will employ sprite-based animation, tiled background, 
                collision detection, physics, AI, efficient memory management, render threading, and 
                more basic 2D game techniques.
            </p>
        <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>
                Shadow Maze will be developed for the Windows/macOS Platform using the <a href="https://github.com/WolfieEngine">Wolfie 2D game engine</a>, which is a bare-bones engine developed by Joe Weaver and Professor Richard McKenna for rapid prototyping 2D games. The artwork will be simple, and so we’ll simply use Piskel.
            </p>
        <h2>Backstory</h2>
            <p>
                It all began with a deadly virus that ravaged the world, causing chaos and devastation. Not only did it kill all humans infected, it also caused mutations in animals, making them extremely aggressive and dangerous. The survivors of a kingdom moved underground, and built a series of mazes to protect themselves from the virus and the mutated creatures that roamed above. 


                Years passed by, and people longed to know if it was safe to return to the surface, but they had forgotten the path through the mazes by then. The prince, a brave and adventurous young man, decided to venture through the mazes to reach the surface. However, they were no longer the peaceful places they had once been. 


                Could the prince make it out alive? 
            </p>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
                The prince’s goal is to find his way through the dangerous underground labyrinths, and return to the surface in order to save humanity. The mazes are dark and full of dead ends, so the prince must be able to find the exits with limited light sources. Not only that, there are many dangerous beasts and creatures lurking in the shadows, so the prince must defeat all that comes his way, including a scary boss monster at the exit of each maze!            </p>
        <h2>GamePlay</h2>
            <p>
                The game will work like a top down game, with the prince being able to run up, down, left, right through various paths available to him.

                The prince will have to be cautious because there are many traps throughout his journey to the outside. The prince will be mentally exhausted as not all the paths will be friendly to him. Some paths may provide hope and some may provide suffering. The prince will only have a limited view of his paths, but with a torch, the prince can increase his radius of light to allow him to see more.
                
                If the prince is lucky enough, he might find a treasure chest containing items that will benefit his journey through the Shadow Mazes. Some of the items can be a lantern or a light stone. The prince has to use his items carefully, because they will be essential for his survival and journey.
                
                The prince’s basic attack will be with a sword, dealing damage to nearby enemies. He has an ultimate ability in the form of a flying sword slash, which requires energy. The prince has an energy bar that can be charged with each basic attack on an enemy, and using his ultimate requires the energy bar to be full. The prince will have to carefully decide when to use his ultimate, since it will be crucial to his survival in the Shadow Mazes.
                
                In order to protect himself from the various traps and monsters throughout the maze, the prince carries a shield. With the shield, the prince can block attacks, and if timed correctly, he has the ability to parry, reflecting ranged attacks and stunning enemies with melee attacks. With each parry, the prince is able to charge his energy bar by a great amount.
